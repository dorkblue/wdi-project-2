## Development

### Notable Challenges

#### 1. Integrating API results into schema

#### 2. Handling (sometimes) disappointing API output
Due to the mysterious workings of the link preview API used, it was unable to pull out images from certain domains, resulting in an empty string being passed instead of an image url. Which basically means, NO PICTURE! :(

Fiddling with the API was out of the question because:
1. I have no idea how
2. It was working perfectly fine on other domains


## Further Development :kissing:
* Put the item description into cards for better uniformity
* Sort items by date created (apparently this is not the default!)
* Add in before delete hook
